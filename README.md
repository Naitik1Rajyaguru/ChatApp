# Node.js Server with Socket.IO

- **Server**:

  - Use `require` statements to include dependencies, similar to imports.

- **Socket.IO**:

  - Run Socket.IO using an HTTP server.

- **Default Server Events**:

  - Leverage default events provided by Socket.IO for handling connections, disconnections, etc.

- **Client Integration**:

- **Custom Events**:
  - Emit custom events from the client and the server.
  - Listen for these events on both the client and the server to enable two-way communication.
